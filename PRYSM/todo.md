To Do List:
--------------------
- [ ] Add output to driver scripts (.mat/.npy)
- [ ] Add plotting scripts for example output (or adapt paper_figure scripts to work seamlessly with driver scripts)
- [ ] Add example output figures to README
- [ ] Write introduction to README (borrow heavily from the paper abstract probably)
